# Getting started with Slyde

## How does Slyde work?

### Markdown

Slyde takes a Markdown document and splits it up into slides wherever it finds a
first, second, or third-level header.

### Formatting

Slyde supports any formatting that Markdown does, including the
not-so-standard features like tables and code fences.

## Who done it?

Slyde was built by Brendan Loudermik ([@bloudermilk][bloudermilk]).
